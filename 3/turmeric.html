   <h2> <img src="t1.jpeg" alt=""> </h2>


<h5>Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has been used for thousands of years for the prevention and treatment of various chronic diseases. Curcumin is just one of >200 ingredients in turmeric. Almost 7000 scientific papers on turmeric and almost 20,000 on curcumin have been published in PubMed. Scientific reports based on cell culture or animal studies are often not reproducible in humans. Therefore, human clinical trials are the best indicators for the prevention and treatment of a disease using a given agent/drug. Herein, we conducted an extensive literature survey on PubMed and Scopus following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The keywords “turmeric and clinical trials” and “curcumin and clinical trials” were considered for data mining. A total of 148 references were found to be relevant for the key term “turmeric and clinical trials”, of which 70 were common in both PubMed and Scopus, 44 were unique to PubMed, and 34 were unique to Scopus. Similarly, for the search term “curcumin and clinical trials”, 440 references were found to be relevant, of which 70 were unique to PubMed, 110 were unique to Scopus, and 260 were common to both databases. These studies show that the golden spice has enormous health and medicinal benefits for humans. This Review will extract and summarize the lessons learned about turmeric and curcumin in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases based on clinical trials.</h5>

    <h2>Disease symptoms
    </h2>
    <img src="t10.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The collar region of the affected pseudostem becomes water soaked and the rotting spreads to the rhizome resulting in soft rot.
    </p>
    <p>Foliar symptoms appear as light yellowing of the tips of lower leaves which gradually spreads to the leaf blades.
    </p>
    <p>Survival and spread <br>
        The disease is soil-borne. The fungus multiplies with buildup of soil moisture with the onset of south west monsoon.
        The fungus can survive in two ways: (a) in diseased rhizomes kept for sowing and (b) through resting structures like chlamydospores and oospores that reach the soil from infected rhizomes.
        Favourable conditionsbr
        <br>
        Younger sprouts are the most susceptible to the pathogen. Nematode infestation aggravates rhizome rot disease.<br>
        Temperature above 30° C and high soil moisture are the important predisposing factors favouring the disease.  <br>
        Water logging in the field due to poor drainage increases the intensity of the disease.  <br>
