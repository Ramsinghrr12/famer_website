 <h1>Problems Faced By Farmers</h1>
 <p>
	Maize cultivation is held back by a lack of resources and training for farmer. These constraints include lack of access to improved varieties and good quality seed, limited access to often expensive fertilisers and pesticides, poor dissemination of good agricultural practice, the need for affordable, small-scale mechanisation to replace manual labour and significant post-harvest losses due to poor storage, pest attack and spoilage
